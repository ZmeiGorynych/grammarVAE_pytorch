In this repo I intend to provide a complete Pytorch port of mkusner/grammarVAE.

In doing so, I of course borrowed freely from said repo, while porting the code to Python 3 and heavily refactoring to eliminate a lot of cut and paste.

Thanks to https://github.com/episodeyang/grammar_variational_autoencoder for an
initial pytorch implementation, which I extended to add proper masking to the loss function,
generalize the code to work with both equations and molecules, and fix a minor bug in the decoder - and intend to extend further.

Instructions on how to install/run coming soon.
